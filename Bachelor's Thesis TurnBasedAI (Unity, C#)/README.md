#Behavior Tree Implementation for a Turn Based Strategy Game

This project was my Bachelor's Thesis. For an earlier developed turn-based strategy game (think 'XCOM') , which was an assignment, i developed a Squad-based AI.
 It utilized Behavior Trees aswell as Blackboards (for a communication between units), and influence maps to evaluate the board state.
 The project was done using Unity and C#.
