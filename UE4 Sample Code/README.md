#C++ Code for Unreal Engine 4

Implemented some experimental features for our core game mechanic (as it was then). We have a wisp as companion (FireflyCompanion) which should 'target' some objects based on it's targetprovider. It looks for objects with StickyTargets as component and rates them.
Also wanted to implement my own movement component.
