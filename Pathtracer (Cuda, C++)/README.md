#Pathtracer (Monte-Carlo-Raytracer)

This project was made with CUDA and C++ for an assignment in 'High Performance Computing' aswell as 'Advanced Game Technology'. First learned about GPGPU Computing with CUDA, splitting work up in a highly parallelized environment.
Features raytracing of spheres with diffuse, reflective and refractive materials.
